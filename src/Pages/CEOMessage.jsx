            <p className="text-[#575756] mt-4">
              It makes me immensely happy to state that during FY24, we
              witnessed steady growth across our product portfolio. However,
              before I delve deeper into the details of our performance, I must
              mention that the trust and confidence of all our stakeholders in
              our vision and capabilities have helped us empower individuals and
              families across India to achieve their dream of home-ownership.

            <p className="text-[#575756]">
              This past year, the Indian economy continued to demonstrate
              remarkable resilience, registering a growth of over 7.6% in
              FY24—uplifting Millions of people from poverty, sheltering their
              lives and bringing them back to the economic mainstream. Rapid
              urbanisation, massive infrastructural development, a consistent
              focus on sustainability and an aspirational young population with
              rising income levels, are acting as tailwinds for the housing
              finance sector.

            <br />
            <p className="text-[#575756]">
              Stabilising interest rates and the government’s commitment to
              ‘Housing for All’ also augur well for the sector as a whole.
              Housing finance companies are capitalising on this opportunity by
              offering innovative products and services, user-friendly digital
              solutions and undertaking targeted marketing campaigns designed to
              resonate with the young demographic, potential first-time home
              buyers across major states in India.

              income groups (LIGs). Over the past five years, the Company’s
              Assets Under Management (AUM) have grown at a 14% CAGR, reaching H

              our commitment to women’s empowerment, financial inclusion and
              social responsibility. At present, we are the leading affordable
              housing finance company in the sub H 25 Lakh loan segment, with an
              average ticket size of H 14.26 Lakh, among the housing finance

              are one of the leading contributors to the Credit Linked Subsidy
