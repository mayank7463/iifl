            A comprehensive understanding of risk management throughout the various
            levels of an organisation helps in driving key decisions related to
            risk-return balance, capital allocation and product pricing.
            Additionally, it is also ensured that there is appropriate focus on
            managing risks proactively by ensuring business operations are in
            accordance with laid-down risk. Our risk management team is guided by
            the Companyâ€™s Risk Management Committee and the Senior Management to
            develop and implement Risk Assurance practices on a pan-organisational
            basis.
