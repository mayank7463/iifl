                    <p>
                        The materiality assessment forms the basis for our sustainable business practices and provides strategic insights for action. We are committed to addressing and reporting on the most significant sustainability issues through a robust materiality assessment conducted periodically. This assessment involves extensive stakeholder engagement and impact assessment.
                        <br /><br />
                        Given the comprehensive nature of our recent assessment, we have retained the identified material topics for FY 2023 and the subsequent two years. Stakeholder responses, analysed on various parameters such as scale, scope, and likelihood, informed our impact assessment and led to the final list of material topics. These topics reflect the priorities of both IIFL and our stakeholders and represent our impact on sustainable development.
                        <br /><br />
                        We will revise and reassess these material topics every three years, engaging our stakeholders to update and formulate relevant policies, ensuring they remain of utmost importance.

                    Stakeholders refer to individuals and organisations who are affected by the activities of a company either directly or indirectly and who may have an influence over a company’s business. We have identified our stakeholders
                    <br /><br />
                    based on the impact and influence they have on our business. We engage with them, seeking their inputs and insights to identify our material topics and this practice of material topic identification is carried out periodically, once in every 3 years. Stakeholders are prioritised depending on their level of impact, interdependence, and responsibility they have towards IIFL HFL.
