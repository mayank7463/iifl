            In a country as vast as India, home-ownership still remains an
            elusive prospect for many. At IIFL Home Loans, we believe in
            empowering people with financial solutions that enrich their
            home-ownership journeys. For us, making affordable housing easily
            accessible to the middle and lower-income population is a
            priority. It drives us to contribute towards the nation’s growth
            story, aligning our initiatives with the government’s vision of
            ‘Housing for All’. It also enables us to ensure financial
            inclusion, thereby making home loans easily accessible for people

            With the Indian economy demonstrating remarkable resilience amidst
            global headwinds, the nation as a whole is poised for remarkable
            progress. Along with retaining its position as the fifth-largest
            economy in the world, India’s influence in the global arena
            continues to improve. Concluding the year with a robust GDP growth
            of 8.2% the Indian economy has showcased great strength and has
            also created a favourable environment for businesses and
            investments to prosper. It has also added impetus to a thriving
            housing finance sector, benefitted from rising demand for quality
            homes at affordable rates.

          <p className="text-[#575756] mt-4">
            Driven by rising income levels, enhanced affordability and
            substantial government support, the Indian housing finance
            industry is on track to report a 13% Compound Annual Growth Rate
            (CAGR) between FY 23-26. In the past few years, specifically in
            the post-Covid period, the industry has seen consistent
            performance, punctuated by occasional seasonal dips. The credit
            outstanding for the housing sector rose by nearly H 10 Lakh
            Crore in the last two fiscal years, to reach a record H 27.23
            Lakh Crore in March this year. This growth is mostly attributed
            to the demand revival in the residential property market due to
            pent-up demand. These developments have positive implications
            for both the Housing Finance Companies (HFCs) and Non-Banking
            Financial Companies (NBFCs).

            A surge in housing demand continues to be noticed in India, with
            a growing preference for mid-to-premium and luxury segments. At
            the same time, government initiatives like ‘Housing for All’
            have created immense opportunities for home-ownership among the
            middle and lower-income population. At IIFL, we strive to make
            home-ownership journeys fulfilling and a reality for a large
            section of India’s aspirational population.

            Our numbers have been good this year. The spread between our
            borrowing and lending has been stellar which is a testament to
            our strategic approach to funding. We have developed a strong

            culture of responsible lending within our company and by
            leveraging NHB’s programs strategically, we achieved a more
