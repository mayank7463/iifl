                        Rising Urbanisation and Per Capita Income
                    </h4>
                    <p>
                        Rapid urbanisation in India is a significant driver for the affordable housing finance sector. As more people move to cities in search of better job opportunities, the demand for housing in urban and peri-urban areas increases. This trend is particularly evident among a growing middle class, looking for affordable housing.
                        <br /><br />
                        Rising per capita income enhances the purchasing power of individuals, making it feasible for a larger segment of the population to consider home- ownership. This continues to drive the demand for affordable homes, particularly in suburban areas, where property prices are relatively lower in comparison to residential areas in the heart of the city.

                        Growing Housing Demand from Small Towns and Cities
                    </h4>
                    <p>
                        The development of affordable housing is gradually shifting from Tier-1 cities to Tier-2 and Tier-3 cities and towns. These regions offer significant untapped potential due to lower penetration of housing finance services and increasing opportunities for income generation. Affordable Housing Finance Companies (AHFCs) are gradually expanding their presence in these areas, recognising the growing demand for housing finance. Additionally, improvement in infrastructure, in the form of better connectivity, roads and utilities, make these emerging markets more attractive for residential projects. Government initiatives to enhance infrastructure in smaller towns also make these locations viable for long- term residential projects.

                        AHFCs are offering innovative financial products tailored to the needs of lower-income and middle-income groups. These include loans with longer tenures, lower interest rates and flexible repayment plans for catering to demographic groups with variable income streams.

                    <p>
                        The use of digital technology for loan processing, from application to disbursement, is transforming the housing finance sector. Digital platforms enable faster processing of loans, ensure better reach and uncover more efficient modes of service delivery, especially in underserved areas. Besides, the use of AI, Machine Learning and advanced technology have helped to assess credit risk more accurately, even for customers with limited credit histories.
