                            This beautiful mural, displayed at the IIFL Home Finance Ltd. head office in Gurgaon, depicts an Indian home with
                            each room representing spaces relevant to women in the household. At IIFL HFL, we firmly believe that women, as the
                            pillars of any and every Indian household, hold a significant position in the home buying process. Women are not only
                            breaking barriers but also are redefining how they use the spaces in the house with each room symbolizing different
                            activities asserting their independence.

                           <div>From the Chaukhat (main door) to the Chhat (terrace), every room in the mural is a symbol of independence and freedom.
                            This artwork celebrates the financial inclusion of women and their journey toward homeownership. It illustrates how
                            women are breaking free from traditional norms and creating spaces where they can live, grow, and thrive. We reckon,
                            women are no longer confined by traditional roles and expectations, while claiming their own homes, redefining spaces,
                            and crafting their own stories!</div>
