                        for the purchase, construction and
                        renovation of homes, we believe in
                        creating spaces for the masses of the
                        country. To enhance affordability and
                        accessibility of home loans, we have
                        implemented a streamlined process
                        with minimal documentation and
                        facilitate quick approvals within 30
                        minutes, our ‘Jhatpat’ solution. We
                        recognise the importance of supporting
                        first-time home buyers, particularly
                        those from the Economically Weaker
                        Section (EWS) and Lower Income
                        Groups (LIG). Therefore, we offer
                        competitive interest rates and flexible
                        repayment terms. By focusing on the
                        needs of the underserved, we are also
                        contributing to the nation’s vision
                        of financial inclusion and broader
                        economic development.</p>
